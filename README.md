GOAL: Our goal for this project is to establish an efficient and easy to navigate cross country website for 
Naperville Central Men's Cross Country. 

We are using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the website. Also, we are borrowing css templates and layouts from popular web design pages to improve aesthetics. 

Sprint #1: We set a general framework ("walking skeleton") for the website. It has a nice homepage with a slider bar for navigation, 
quick links, pictures, and also an embedded twitter feed. 

In review, we are happy with our progress and will continue to build off of our foundation by adding: a meet information tab, 
a google doc with important announcments and results, and also an about us page. This will occur during Sprint #2 and following sprints.
